##Â Release guide

Releases are done automatically via CI. To create a new release:

1. Increment the `version` in `package.json` as required, as part of a new or existing Pull Request.
3. Once the approved PR has been merged, run `git tag <version>` (where `<version>` is same as in `package.json`) on the merge commit.
5. Run `git push --tags`
6. The CI server will now do a build and deploy to NPM.
